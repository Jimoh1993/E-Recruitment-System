Achievers Continuous Education Centre was initially a family business of Hon. Dr. Bode Ayorinde. The business was formally registered in 1994 as a private limited liability company. However, the decision to expand the scope of the Educational Institute towards the establishment of a private University caused the family to invite notable personalities to join the company. The offer, through a private placement attracted important personalities like Chief Mrs. Olutoyin Olakunri, Sen. T.O Olupitan, Late Sen Kolawole, Professors and Senior Academics to subscribe to the shares. In all, 90 shareholders emerged and became the owners of the University.
